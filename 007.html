		I could build a clock tower. I could be a sentry for a bridge. I could be a gate keeper for a tunnel. I could be a big old bell with a crack in it. I could be a chair that no one can sit on. I could be a bridge that can only be crossed in pairs. I could be a home. I could be a city. I could be a country. I could be a body. I could be a story. I could be a thousand things but right now I'm just a website.
